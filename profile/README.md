# 🏗️ BoGar - AI-Driven Construction Document Assistant  

BoGar is an AI-powered assistant designed to streamline construction workflows by enabling foremen, field workers, and project managers to interact with construction documents through natural language queries. The system leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal understanding, and mobile-first access to provide intelligent insights on plans, scopes, and specs.
